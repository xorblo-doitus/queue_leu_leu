Or for installation with a clone of this repo: ``pip install .``

If you want to build it yourself, install the module ``build`` and run the command: ``python -m build``.


### Dependencies
All the scripts use [PyGame](https://github.com/pygame/pygame) to work. <br>
Mainly, to use the [Vector2](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/math.html?highlight=vector2#pygame.math.Vector2) object, but you can use any other library that includes standard Vector things. <br>
The rest, is just to visualize the algorithms with more informations.
